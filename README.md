# Algorithms
1. Mundane algorithms and data structures for practice or learning. A CS major typically learned this kind of algo in freshman or sophomore years. Also consitute the majority of the algos you can find on leetcode.
2. ML and AI algorithms that are self-contained
3. ML and AI applications used to showcase the usage of some algorithms. The algos themselves don't make sense unless put them in some context.
